# Computational Neurology at the University of Bonn

Welcome to the *Computational Neurology Working/Research/Interest Group* at the [University of Bonn](https://neurologie.uni-bonn.de/) and [German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE)](https://dzne.de/en/). The group consists of interdisciplinary researchers from medicine and computer science and has been founded by (has been initiated by, is led by) [Dr. Xenia Kobeleva](https://xenia-kobeleva.com).

## Our Mission/Aims/Goals

Computational Neurology integrates two approaches for understanding and treating neurodegenerative diseases such as [Alzheimer's](https://alz.org/), [ALS](https://als.org/), and [Parkinson's disease](https://parkinson.org/). We apply methods of machine learning in order to analyze big data on brain dynamics and based on this model the mathematical mechanics which underlie neurogenerative diseases. In the Working/Research/Interest Group, we apply and integrate methods on imaging and clinical data (such as fMRT, YYY, and ZZZ) in order to answer clinically relevant questions. We therefore contribute both to the understanding of neurological diseases as well as to the development of new diagnostics and therapies.
